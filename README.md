# Calculator-Application-GUI-Python

What is a Calculator?

For those who do not know, a Calculator is basically a program on a computer that simulates the behavior of any hand-held calculator useful for performing Mathematical Calculations. It is a very basic device used in our every day lives. Now all the smartphones also have a Calculator application in them.

While creating any GUI Application there are mainly two steps:

The first step is to create a User Interface.

The second step is the most important one and in this, to Add functionalities to the GUI

Now let's begin with creating a simple calculator app using Tkinter in Python which is used for basic arithmetic calculations.

Calculator App Code

Now it's time to take a look at the code to create a Calculator App using Tkinter.

Here is how our calculator will look, which is made by using the input field, buttons and for the calculation purpose we will use logic in our code defined in functions, like if you want to add two numbers then behind this there must be a logic for addition purpose, similarly for substraction, multiplication, etc, we have created functions whose task is to perform these operations.

Now we will show you a snapshot as the output of the above code. And yes you can implement it on your system for more clear understanding of Calculator App Using Tkinter:

We have an Input Field in which the user input will be shown and the final result of the calculation will be displayed.

And the buttons are like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, -, *, /, =, ., and C(clear button)

There are a variety of functions in Tkinter with the help of them it becomes easy and convenient to make a simple calculator just with this little code.
